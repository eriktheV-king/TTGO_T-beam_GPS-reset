# TTGO_T-beam_GPS-reset
Reset U-blox NEO GPS devices on TTGO T-beam T22- V1.0 and 1.1 to bring back NMEA output on GPS serial line.

Purpose:
The sketch T22-GPS-reset-v3 will bring back U-blox GPS N6M & N8M NMEA 9600 baud serial
on TTGO T-beam T22- V1.0 and 1.1 and also on 0.7 T-beams (uncomment yours).
In case you're having trouble because your T-beam's GPS doesn't show NMEA output anymore, you should first try this v3 sketch, which is not restoring factory settings. Normally this is sufficient to bring your NMEA output back on serial.

In case you still don't get your NMEA back, you might need something more drastic, like sketch T22-GPS-restoreFactory-v2. This will reset U-blox NEO GPS devices on TTGO T-beam T22- V1.0 and 1.1. It will bring back U-blox GPS N6M & N8M factory settings 
so that NMEA 9600 over the GPS serial output is enabled.

## PlatformIO usage

1. For PlatformIO, we default to `T22-GPS-reset-v3` version.
   You'll want to give it an environment variable named `PLATFORMIO_SRC_DIR=variant_name` to build different version.
2. Run `pio run -t upload -t monitor` to upload and start serial port monitor.
3. Watch its output. It's likely to work and reset your GPS module settings.
